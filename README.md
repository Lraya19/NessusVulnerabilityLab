<h1>Nessus - Vulnerability Management Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of using Nessus Essentials to identify vulnerabilities in networks and systems. It scans for weaknesses, helping organizations fortify their defenses against cyber threats. We'll cover vulnerability scanning as well as remediation, which are two of the main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. We will scan local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation in order to run credentialed scans. By doing so we will discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of these vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>
 
- <b>Nessus Essentials</b>
- <b>VMWare Workstation</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

Launch the utility: 
 <br/> To begin, we will deploy Nessus Essentials to scan our local VM’s network and systems comprehensively. This powerful vulnerability scanner actively seeks out vulnerabilities in software, configurations, and network services, providing detailed reports on discovered weaknesses. These findings are then categorized and prioritized based on their potential impact and exploitability.

<br />
On our VM, we use the command line and prompt ‘ipconfig’ to discover our VM’s IP address which we will ping on our host computer:

<br />
<br />
Once we identify the IP for our VM, we can go ahead and create a new basic scan, give it a name, and input that IP address into the targets section. This will allow our host computer to target our Virtual Machine: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Once vulnerabilities are identified, we assess their severity and potential risks to the organization’s assets. Vulnerabilities with the highest risk are addressed promptly, while lower-priority issues are placed in a remediation queue:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
These scans help us in the remediation phase by offering recommendations and guidance on how to mitigate or patch identified vulnerabilities:  <br/>

<br />
<br />Nessus can be configured to schedule regular scans and monitor the network continuously, ensuring that any new vulnerabilities are promptly identified and addressed.
